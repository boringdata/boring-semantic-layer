  "markdown": "# Query Agent: BSL as MCP\n\nExpose any set of `SemanticTable` objects through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so Claude Desktop can call your semantic layer as if it were a native data source. The `MCPSemanticModel` class in [`src/boring_semantic_layer/agents/backends/mcp.py`](../../src/boring_semantic_layer/agents/backends/mcp.py) wraps the BSL semantics and registers four tools that map directly to what an LLM needs to stay grounded:\n\n1. `list_models` -> discover which semantic models are available.\n2. `get_model` -> inspect dimensions, measures, calculated measures, and join metadata.\n3. `get_time_range` -> fetch the min/max timestamps so the agent can ask for the right filters.\n4. `query_model` -> run an actual BSL query with dimensions, measures, filters, order, limit, and Vega or Plotly chart specs.\n\n## Minimal MCP server\n\n```python\nfrom boring_semantic_layer import MCPSemanticModel, to_semantic_table\nimport ibis\n\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect(\":memory:\")\nflights_raw = con.read_parquet(\"flights.parquet\")\n\nflights = (\n    to_semantic_table(flights_raw, name=\"flights\")\n    .with_dimensions(origin=lambda t: t.origin, carrier=lambda t: t.carrier)\n    .with_measures(flight_count=lambda t: t.count())\n)\n\nmcp_server = MCPSemanticModel(models={\"flights\": flights}, name=\"Flight Data Server\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp_server.run(transport=\"stdio\")\n```\n\nDrop this script into your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`) and relaunch. Claude now has structured knowledge of every dimension description, smallest time grain, and measure you defined.\n\n## Usage tips\n\n- Author rich descriptions inside your semantic tables; Claude surfaces them inside the MCP tooltips.\n- When you join multiple semantic tables, remind users to prefix fields (`flights.origin`). The `get_model` response explains this for you.\n- Reuse the same YAML or Python models you load into the CLI. MCP simply adds a transport layer for Claude.\n\nWant end-to-end screenshots and setup steps? The standalone [MCP documentation](/querying/mcp) walks through credential setup, `claude_desktop_config.json`, and server lifecycle management.\n",
