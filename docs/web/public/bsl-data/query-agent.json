  "markdown": "# Query Agent\n\nThe Query Agent is the easiest way to ask natural-language questions of your semantic tables.\n\nIt converts a user's prompt into a valid BSL query and returns the resulting table or chart together with a concise summary.\n\nDepending on your workflow, you can expose the Query Agent in several ways:\n\n- [**BSL as an MCP integration**](/agents/query/mcp) \u2014 give an LLM access to your tables via an MCP interface.\n\n- [**BSL as an LLM tool**](/agents/query/llm-tool) \u2014 expose BSL as a callable tool for the model to use.\n\n- [**BSL as a skill for Claude Code / Codex / Cursor**](/agents/query/skill) \u2014 add querying capabilities to your local coding assistant.\n\nChoose the surface that best matches your needs \u2014 each option offers the same core querying power but integrates differently depending on where and how you run your LLM.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [BSL as an MCP integration](/agents/query/mcp) | Zero custom UI; Claude Desktop immediately understands your models | Requires running an MCP server alongside your project |\n| [BSL as an LLM tool](/agents/query/llm-tool) | Works in CLI, Slack, or any LangChain stack with full control | Needs LangChain wiring plus hosting infra/tokens |\n| [BSL as a skill](/agents/query/skill) | Fastest to share\u2014paste the skill into any local coding agent | No automatic tool execution unless paired with MCP/CLI |\n",
